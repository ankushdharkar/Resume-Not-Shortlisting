                <p class="lead">You've sent out dozens of applications. Maybe hundreds. And yet, silence. No interviews, no callbacks, just the occasional automated rejection email. Here's why.</p>

                    <h2>There's Too Much Noise</h2>
                    <p>Your resume "looks" awesome, but so do many others. For an SDE-2 role, I've personally seen 8500+ resumes in less than a week. Can you imagine reading them all while managing interviews, offers, and more?</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Reality:</strong> You're competing against thousands. Looking good isn't enough—you need to stand out.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="reason-card">
                    <div class="reason-number">02</div>
                    <h2>Recruiters Filter for Signals</h2>
                    <p>Recruiters filter for signals: Prestigious institutions (IITs, NITs, BITs), renowned companies, popular speakers or online channels, notable open source contributions. Most freshers won't clear this early filter.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Build your own signals. Contribute to open source, speak at meetups, build in public. Create credentials that make recruiters stop scrolling.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="reason-number">03</div>
                    <h2>The "Give Me a Chance" Mindset</h2>
                    <p>"If I am given a chance, I will prove myself" — This mindset needs to die. With access to endless resources online, showcasing tech skills isn't unique anymore. What's missing is intent and discipline.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Stop waiting for permission. Prove yourself before anyone asks. Build projects, share learnings, demonstrate capability upfront.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="reason-number">04</div>
                    <h2>You Can't Navigate Ambiguity</h2>
                    <p>Navigating unknowns and making sense of tons of info is a crucial skill. Anything with a defined path often has lower value because it's oversupplied. Most are trying the least to be eligible for the most.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Think about what the company actually needs. Stop following the crowd. Carve your own path.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="reason-card">
                    <div class="reason-number">05</div>
                    <h2>You're Not Thinking Company-Centric</h2>
                    <p>Start thinking about what you can offer with your unique skills, experiences, and smarts. You should get a job because you have the skills, not the other way around.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Research company pain-points. Understand their challenges. Position yourself as the solution, not just another applicant.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>You Think Like You're Still in College</h2>
                    <p>The era of standardized exams for a "rat-race" list of colleges is over. In real life, every company seeks profit and none runs a charity. Getting noticed is a complex multivariable problem. There's no roadmap.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> STANDOUT to be VISIBLE. Stop looking for a formula. Create your own visibility.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>You Haven't Adapted to the New Reality</h2>
                    <p>We're in a private job sector with no guaranteed forever jobs. Before tech jobs, people networked to get their jobs. A degree gets you a step closer, but hundreds of steps remain.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Adapt to changing times (especially in tech). The rules have changed—learn the new game.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>You Don't Understand How Hiring Works</h2>
                    <p>Here's a top secret: HUMANS HIRE HUMANS THEY TRUST. Word of mouth, aka referrals, are powerful. Not random referrals, but from people who genuinely know you and can advocate on your behalf.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Build relationships before you need them. Be someone others want to vouch for.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="reason-card">
                    <div class="reason-number">09</div>
                    <h2>You Started Networking Too Late</h2>
                    <p>You need to NETWORK early. Yes, even from your first year. When you need a job is the wrong time to start. Building real networks takes trust, visibility, and CONSISTENCY.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Shake hands, attend conferences, be active in online communities. Start today, not when you're desperate.

                </div>

                    <h2>You're Not a Magnet for Opportunities</h2>
                    <p>Become a magnet for opportunities. Create a persona around your interests. People should think of you when they need a skillset.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Become the person people think of—"Oh, I know this amazing UI dev who does awesome things in React."

                    <p>Yes, this takes time and No, there are no shortcuts. A strong network is no substitute for lacking skills. Work on yourself and consistently share what you've achieved.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Put in the work. Build real skills. Be consistent. There's no hack for this.

                    <h2>ATS Can't Read Your Resume</h2>
                    <p>Applicant Tracking Systems parse your resume before any human sees it. Fancy designs, tables, columns, graphics, and unusual fonts? The ATS sees gibberish. Your carefully crafted resume becomes digital confetti.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Use a simple, single-column layout. Standard fonts. No tables or text boxes. Save as .docx or a simple PDF.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>You're Not Using the Right Keywords</h2>
                    <p>The job description is literally a cheat sheet. It tells you exactly what words the ATS is scanning for. If the posting says "project management" and you wrote "managed projects," you might not match.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Mirror the exact language from the job description. If they say "stakeholder management," don't say "working with people."

                    <h2>Your Resume Says Nothing Specific</h2>
                    <p>"Responsible for managing team operations" tells a recruiter nothing. So does "hardworking team player with excellent communication skills." These are empty words that everyone uses.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Quantify everything. "Led a team of 8 engineers to deliver a $2M project 3 weeks early" is a story. Numbers make you real.

                    <p>Applying to 100 jobs you're barely qualified for is less effective than applying to 10 you're perfect for. "Entry-level" jobs asking for 5 years of experience? That's a listing problem, not a you problem. Move on.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Target roles where you match 70-80% of requirements. Focus your energy on quality applications, not quantity.

                    <h2>Your Resume is Too Long (or Too Short)</h2>
                    <p>Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on initial resume scans. A 4-page resume? They won't read it. A half-page resume? You look inexperienced. Neither extreme works in your favor.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> 1 page for early career (0-5 years). 2 pages for experienced professionals. Never more than 2 unless you're in academia.

                    <h2>You Have Typos and Errors</h2>
                    <p>One typo might seem minor. But to a hiring manager reviewing 200 resumes, it's an easy reason to say no. "Attention to detail" rings hollow when your resume has three spelling mistakes.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Read it backwards. Use Grammarly. Have someone else review it. Print it out—errors are easier to spot on paper.

                    <h2>Your Contact Info is Wrong (or Missing)</h2>
                    <p>It sounds absurd, but people forget to add their email. Or they have an old phone number. Or their LinkedIn URL is broken. Recruiters won't hunt for ways to contact you.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Test every link. Call your own phone number. Send yourself an email. Make sure everything works.

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>Your resume isn't getting shortlisted because the system is designed to filter people out, not in. The ATS is looking for reasons to reject you. Recruiters are overwhelmed and looking for quick decisions.</p>
                <p>Your job is to make it impossible to ignore you. Make your resume ATS-friendly. Tailor it for each application. Quantify your impact. And most importantly, don't rely on applications alone—network your way in.</p>
                <p class="final">Once you have good communication, a strong network and great skills, jobs will follow much more easily.</p>
