                    <h2>ATS Can't Read Your Resume</h2>
                    <p>Applicant Tracking Systems parse your resume before any human sees it. Fancy designs, tables, columns, graphics, and unusual fonts? The ATS sees gibberish. Your carefully crafted resume becomes digital confetti.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Use a simple, single-column layout. Standard fonts. No tables or text boxes. Save as .docx or a simple PDF.
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="reason-number">02</div>
                    <h2>You're Not Using Keywords</h2>
                    <p>The job description is literally a cheat sheet. It tells you exactly what words the ATS is scanning for. If the posting says "project management" and you wrote "managed projects," you might not match.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Mirror the exact language from the job description. If they say "stakeholder management," don't say "working with people."
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>Your Resume Says Nothing</h2>
                    <p>"Responsible for managing team operations" tells a recruiter nothing. So does "hardworking team player with excellent communication skills." These are empty words that everyone uses.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Quantify everything. "Led a team of 8 engineers to deliver a $2M project 3 weeks early" is a story. Numbers make you real.

                    <h2>You're Applying to the Wrong Jobs</h2>
                    <p>Applying to 100 jobs you're barely qualified for is less effective than applying to 10 you're perfect for. "Entry-level" jobs asking for 5 years of experience? That's a listing problem, not a you problem. Move on.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Target roles where you match 70-80% of requirements. Focus your energy on quality applications, not quantity.

                    <div class="reason-number">05</div>
                    <h2>Your Resume is Too Long (or Too Short)</h2>
                    <p>Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds on initial resume scans. A 4-page resume? They won't read it. A half-page resume? You look inexperienced. Neither extreme works in your favor.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> 1 page for early career (0-5 years). 2 pages for experienced professionals. Never more than 2 unless you're in academia.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="reason-card">
                    <div class="reason-number">06</div>
                    <h2>You Have Typos and Errors</h2>
                    <p>One typo might seem minor. But to a hiring manager reviewing 200 resumes, it's an easy reason to say no. "Attention to detail" rings hollow when your resume has three spelling mistakes.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Read it backwards. Use Grammarly. Have someone else review it. Print it out—errors are easier to spot on paper.

                    <h2>Your Contact Info is Wrong (or Missing)</h2>
                    <p>It sounds absurd, but people forget to add their email. Or they have an old phone number. Or their LinkedIn URL is broken. Recruiters won't hunt for ways to contact you.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Test every link. Call your own phone number. Send yourself an email. Make sure everything works.

                    <h2>You're Relying Only on Job Boards</h2>
                    <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth: 70-80% of jobs are filled through networking and referrals. When you apply online, you're competing with hundreds of other applicants. When you get referred, you skip the line.</p>
                    <div class="fix">
                        <strong>Fix it:</strong> Network strategically. Reach out to people at companies you want to work for. Ask for informational interviews. A referral is worth 100 applications.

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>Your resume isn't getting shortlisted because the system is designed to filter people out, not in. The ATS is looking for reasons to reject you. Recruiters are overwhelmed and looking for quick decisions.</p>
                <p>Your job is to make it impossible to ignore you. Make your resume ATS-friendly. Tailor it for each application. Quantify your impact. And most importantly, don't rely on applications alone—network your way in.</p>
                <p class="final">The jobs are out there. Make sure your resume actually gets seen.</p>
